# Cancer Data Analysis and EDA Project

## Project Vision
This project leverages advanced analytics and global health data to uncover actionable insights into cancer care, outcomes, and disparities. Using a comprehensive dataset of 50,000 cancer patient records collected from multiple countries (2015–2024), this project bridges the gap between raw data and life-saving decisions.

## Dataset Overview
Our dataset provides a 360-degree view of cancer patient profiles, including:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, country, year of diagnosis
- **Genetic & Lifestyle Risks:** Genetic predisposition, smoking, alcohol use, obesity
- **Environmental Exposure:** Air pollution levels
- **Clinical & Economic Variables:** Cancer type, stage, treatment cost
- **Patient Outcomes:** Survival years, severity scores

## Core Objectives

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify key trends, hidden patterns, and relationships
- Visualize disparities in diagnosis, lifestyle, treatment, and outcomes
- Highlight variations across countries, age groups, and cancer stages

### 2. Inferential & Predictive Analytics
Using statistical and predictive methods, we aim to answer critical healthcare questions:

- Determine the relationship between risk factors and cancer severity
- Analyze the proportion of early-stage diagnoses by cancer type
- Identify key predictors of cancer severity and survival years
- Explore the economic burden of cancer treatment across different demographics and countries
- Assess whether higher treatment costs are associated with longer survival
- Evaluate if higher cancer stages lead to greater treatment costs and reduced survival years
- Examine whether higher genetic risk amplifies the negative effects of smoking on cancer severity and survival outcomes

### 3. Insight Extraction and Documentation
- Draw clear, evidence-backed inferences for each major analysis
- Systematically document findings for clinical, academic, and operational use
- Link insights to real-world implications to guide decision-making and policy formulation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization and statistical modeling libraries
